If the csv file exists and is located in the same directory as your working Jupyter notebook (.ipynb file), then the data contained in the file will be used to populate the spreadsheet that opens.  If the csv file doesn't exist, then an empty spreadsheet will be opened.  In addition, the file 'csv_name.csv' will be created and it will contain whatever data you enter into the spreadsheet.\n",

    "Furthermore, for each column of data you enter into the spreadsheet, a vector representing a list of values from that column will be created.  For example, if you have a column with named 'position' in the spreadsheet, then a vector called 'v_position' that contains all of the data from that column will be created.  This vector can then be used in other operations such as calculations or plotting.  \n",
